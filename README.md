# simon-game
one of my first projects using JS, the game is played by repeating the pattern of the buttons

The game is started by pressing any key on the keyboard.
The game begins by flashing a button then you have to press the button that flashed,
then another button is added to the sequence, 
and so on untill you fail to press the buttons in the coresponding sequence.
